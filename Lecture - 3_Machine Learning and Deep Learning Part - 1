Machine Learning and Deep Learning – Part 1

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is the study and construction of programs that learn patterns from data rather than being explicitly programmed with fixed rules.
 It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on learning from experience (data) to make predictions or decisions.
The more data an ML algorithm is exposed to, the better it can learn the underlying patterns—although performance eventually plateaus due to diminishing returns.

How ML Algorithms Learn:
ML systems learn from examples, not from explicit human instructions.
 They improve performance through repeated exposure to data.
Example – Email Spam Detection:
•	Start with a labeled dataset (emails marked “spam” or “not spam”).
•	The ML algorithm learns the distinguishing patterns.
•	Once trained, it can classify new incoming emails as spam or not spam automatically.

Features and Targets:
•	Features: Measurable input variables used to make predictions.
•	Target: The output or label that the algorithm tries to predict.
Example – Iris Dataset:
•	Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.
•	Target: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).
 The model uses the four features to predict the species of the flower.

Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning:
Supervised Learning:
•	Data includes labeled outcomes (target values).
•	Goal: Learn a mapping from features → target.
•	Examples:
o	Email spam classification
o	Fraud detection
o	Iris flower species prediction
Unsupervised Learning:
•	Data has no labels (no target column).
•	Goal: Discover hidden structure or groupings in data.
•	Example: Customer segmentation—grouping similar customers for marketing.
In unsupervised learning, there is no single correct answer; results are evaluated based on how meaningful or useful the discovered patterns are.

Example ML Tasks:
Supervised Example – Fraud Detection:
•	Dataset includes labeled transactions (“fraud” or “not fraud”).
•	Features might include: transaction time, amount, location, and category.
•	The model learns to predict whether a new transaction is fraudulent.
Unsupervised Example – Customer Segmentation:
•	Dataset has customer information without labels.
•	The goal is to group customers into segments for targeted campaigns.

Traditional Machine Learning Summary:
Structured datasets with well-defined, intuitive features (like numbers or categories) are ideal for traditional ML methods.
 For such data, algorithms like decision trees, logistic regression, or SVMs perform effectively in predicting outcomes or finding structures.
