Significance Levels and P values

1. The Big Picture

Hypothesis testing helps us decide whether the data provides enough evidence to reject a “no effect” or “status quo” claim (the null hypothesis, H₀).
To make that decision, we calculate:

A test statistic — derived from our sample data

A P-value — how extreme that statistic is if H₀ were true

A significance level (α) — our predefined cutoff for what counts as “too extreme”

2. Significance Level (α)

Definition: The significance level represents the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.
It is the probability of making a Type I error, meaning rejecting H₀ when it is actually true.

Common values:

α = 0.10 → more tolerant of false positives

α = 0.05 → standard level used in most studies

α = 0.01 or 0.001 → very strict, used in critical applications such as medicine

Interpretation:
If α = 0.05, we are willing to accept a 5% chance of incorrectly concluding that there is an effect when there actually isn’t.

3. P-Value (Probability Value)

Definition:
The P-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than what was observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Mathematically:

𝑃=𝑃(data as or more extreme than observed∣𝐻0 true)
P=P(data as or more extreme than observed∣H0 true)

Interpretation:

Small P → data is unlikely under H₀ → reject H₀

Large P → data is plausible under H₀ → fail to reject H₀

Decision rule:

If P ≤ α, reject the null hypothesis.

If P > α, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

4. Coin Toss Example

Setup:

Null hypothesis (H₀): The coin is fair → P(Heads) = 0.5

Alternative (H₁): The coin is biased toward tails → P(Heads) < 0.5

Observed: 3 heads in 10 flips

Step 1: Choose significance level
α = 0.05

Step 2: Compute the P-value
Under H₀ (a fair coin), the number of heads follows a binomial distribution:

𝑋∼Binomial(𝑛=10,𝑝=0.5)
X∼Binomial(n=10,p=0.5)

We calculate:

𝑃(𝑋≤3)=0.171
P(X≤3)=0.171

This means there is a 17.1% chance of observing 3 or fewer heads in 10 flips if the coin is fair.

Step 3: Compare with α
Since 0.171 > 0.05, we fail to reject H₀.
The data is not extreme enough to conclude that the coin is unfair.

5. Business Applications
Scenario	Null Hypothesis (H₀)	Alternative (H₁)	Appropriate α	Reasoning
Marketing Campaign	The campaign has no effect on sales	The campaign increases sales	0.10	Less harm in a false positive
Medical Drug Test	The drug has no effect	The drug helps recovery	0.001	Critical to avoid false positives
Website Layout A/B Test	The layout change has no impact	The layout change affects traffic	0.05	Balanced approach
6. Relationship Between Significance Level, Power, and Sample Size

Lower α reduces the chance of a Type I error but increases the chance of a Type II error (failing to detect a real effect).

Larger sample sizes increase the power of the test, meaning a higher probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.

Choosing α should balance the seriousness of errors and the practical context of the decision.
