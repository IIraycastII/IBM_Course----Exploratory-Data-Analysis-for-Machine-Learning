Correlation vs Causation

1. Correlation vs. Causation
Correlation

Two variables move together — when one changes, the other tends to change too.

However: this does not imply that one causes the other.

Useful for prediction, but not for understanding why.

Example:
Rain and temperature are correlated, but the direction or cause depends on geography and the underlying weather mechanisms.

Causation

There is a cause-and-effect relationship.
Changing X actually changes Y.

Requires an underlying mechanism or experiment to confirm.

Example:
Studying more causes better test performance (not the other way around).

2. When Correlation Happens

Correlation between X and Y can exist for multiple reasons:

Case	Explanation	Example
X causes Y	The ideal case — genuine causal effect	Marketing spend increases revenue
Y causes X	Reverse causation	Higher revenue lets you increase marketing budget
Both caused by a third variable (confounder)	A hidden variable influences both X and Y	Holiday season increases both marketing spend and revenue
Spurious/random correlation	Pure coincidence in a sample	Ice cream sales and drowning incidents both increase with temperature
3. Confounding Variables

A confounding variable affects both X and Y, making them appear correlated even though there’s no direct causal link.

Examples:

Car accidents and number of people named John
→ Confounder: population size

Ice-cream sales and drownings
→ Confounder: temperature

Factories owned and chips sold
→ Confounder: market demand

Key idea: A confounder can create false signals of causality.

4. Spurious Correlations

These are coincidental relationships that occur due to random patterns or shared trends (like both variables increasing over time).

Examples:

Age of Miss America ↔ Murders by steam, hot vapors, and hot objects (r = 0.87)

Non-commercial space launches ↔ Sociology PhDs awarded

These correlations are statistically strong but meaningless causally.

5. Predictive Value vs. Causal Value

Even if a variable correlates with an outcome, it can be useful for prediction in machine learning or regression.

But — if you manipulate X expecting Y to change, and X is not truly causal, your intervention will fail.

That’s why understanding the mechanism (how and why X influences Y) is essential.
