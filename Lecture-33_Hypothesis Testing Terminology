Lecture-33: 
Hypothesis Testing Terminology

Key Concepts Introduced
1. Test Statistic

A test statistic is a value calculated from sample data used to decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
It condenses sample evidence into a single numerical value.

Example: The likelihood ratio from the coin-tossing example.

If this ratio exceeds a threshold, we reject 𝐻0(fair coin).

If not, we fail to reject 𝐻0.

2. Rejection Region

The rejection region is the range of test statistic values where the null hypothesis is rejected.

It is determined by the significance level (𝛼α).

Example: For a z-test with 𝛼=0.05
α=0.05, the rejection region could be 𝑧>1.96 z>1.96 (for a one-tailed test).

3. Acceptance Region

The acceptance (or non-rejection) region is the range of test statistic values for which we accept or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

4. Null Distribution

The null distribution is the probability distribution of the test statistic assuming 𝐻0 is true.
It’s used to determine how extreme the observed test statistic is and thus whether to reject 𝐻0.

Business Examples of Hypothesis Testing
Example 1: Marketing Intervention

Goal: Determine if a direct mail marketing campaign impacts customer purchases.

Hypotheses:

𝐻0
H0: The campaign has no effect on purchases.

𝐻1
H1: The campaign does impact purchases.

Approach:

Compare purchase rates between those who received the mail vs. those who didn’t.

Use a difference-in-means test or proportion test.

Example 2: Website Layout Test (A/B Testing)

Goal: Determine if a new website layout affects web traffic or conversions.

Hypotheses:

𝐻0
H0: The layout change has no effect on traffic.

𝐻1
H1: The layout change does have an effect.

Approach:

Randomly assign users to old vs. new layout groups.

Measure key metrics (click-through rate, conversion rate).

Use a two-sample t-test or z-test.

Example 3: Product Quality / Size Consistency

Goal: Check if products from different factories meet the expected size 𝑆S.

Hypotheses:

𝐻0
H0: The average product size = 𝑆S.

𝐻1
H1: The average product size ≠ 𝑆S.

Approach:

Take random samples from factories.

Calculate sample mean and standard deviation.

Conduct a one-sample t-test.

If results fall in the rejection region, product size deviates significantly from 𝑆S.
