Bayesian representation of Hypothesis testing example

Concept Overview:
This section explains how Bayesian hypothesis testing builds upon the coin-toss example by incorporating prior beliefs (priors) into our decision-making process. Unlike the frequentist approach, Bayesian inference updates our belief about which hypothesis is more likely after seeing the data, producing a posterior probability for each hypothesis.

Setup:

We have two coins:

Coin 1: 
𝑃(heads)=0.5
P(heads)=0.5

Coin 2: 
𝑃(heads)=0.7
P(heads)=0.7

One coin is chosen at random (we don’t know which) and tossed 10 times.

Based on the number of heads observed, we estimate which coin is more likely to have been chosen.

Step 1: Define Priors

Since the coin was chosen randomly, we start with equal priors:

𝑃(𝐻1)=0.5 and 𝑃(𝐻2)=0.5
P(H1)=0.5 and P(H2)=0.5

meaning both coins are equally likely before observing any data.

However, if we were drawing from real-world coins (where most are fair), our prior for the fair coin could be much higher — for example,
𝑃(𝐻1)=0.99,
𝑃(𝐻2)=0.01
P(H1)=0.99,P(H2)=0.01

making it harder to conclude bias unless the data strongly supports it.

Step 2: Apply Bayes’ Rule

We use Bayes’ theorem to update our belief about each hypothesis after observing the data (e.g., 3 heads in 10 tosses):

𝑃(𝐻𝑖∣data)=𝑃(data∣𝐻𝑖)⋅𝑃(𝐻𝑖)𝑃(data)
P(Hi∣data)=P(data)P(data∣Hi)⋅P(Hi)​

𝑃(data∣𝐻𝑖)
P(data∣Hi) = likelihood of observing the data under hypothesis 𝐻𝑖Hi	​

𝑃(𝐻𝑖)P(Hi) = prior belief before seeing the data

𝑃(𝐻𝑖∣data)P(Hi​∣data) = posterior probability, our updated belief

The denominator 
𝑃(data)
P(data) just normalizes probabilities — it’s not essential for comparing hypotheses.

Step 3: Likelihood Ratio and Updating

The likelihood ratio compares how likely the observed data is under each hypothesis:

Likelihood Ratio=𝑃(data∣𝐻1)𝑃(data∣𝐻2)
Likelihood Ratio=P(data∣H2)P(data∣H1)
	​


In Bayesian analysis, we multiply the priors by this likelihood ratio to get the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds
=
Prior Odds
×
Likelihood Ratio
Posterior Odds=Prior Odds×Likelihood Ratio

If the priors are equal (50/50), they cancel out — so the decision depends solely on the data.
If priors are unequal (e.g., 0.99 vs 0.01), much stronger evidence is needed to favor the less probable hypothesis.

Key Idea:

Likelihood Ratio → comes from data.

Priors → come from prior belief or experience.

Posteriors → updated probabilities after combining both.
