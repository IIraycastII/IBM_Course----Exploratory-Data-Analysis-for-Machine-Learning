Lecture 1
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Overview and Structure:
1.	The video introduces the concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL)
2.	It clarifies how DL is a subset of ML, which is itself a subset of AI.
3.	This lecture highlights that deep learning has helped overcome many limitations of classical machine learning, constantly growing in a new era for AI

Historical Development:
1.	The lecture walks through the history of AI, including cycles of intense development followed by declines, eventually leading to today's rapid progress and boom in AI research and application.
2.	The current trajectory of AI is compared to past advancements (such as electricity), emphasizing how today’s progress differs due to breakthroughs in DL and supporting technologies.

Major Breakthroughs:
1.	Two central AI breakthroughs:
a.	Image Classification: Computers have surpassed human accuracy in recognizing objects (e.g., identifying cats vs. dogs from pictures).
b.	Machine Translation: AI systems can translate sentences between languages to near-human performance, accounting for word order, phrasing, and common usage.

2.	Challenges and Innovations:
a.	The lecturer explains that classical ML struggled with complex data types like images (feature extraction was hard) and languages (not just word-level translation).
b.	Recent advances in deep learning, as well as hardware and data storage, have enabled significant improvements in both image processing and natural language translation.

3.	Industry Impact:
a.	AI’s transformative effect spans multiple industries, such as:
i.	Targeted digital advertising
ii.	Targeted digital advertising
iii.	Self-driving vehicles and smart transportation
iv.	Smart homes with voice command entertainment and security

4.	Definitions:
a.	Artificial Intelligence (AI): Any program or system that senses, reasons, acts, and adapts, simulating human-like intelligent behavior.
b.	Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI; systems that improve their performance as more data is exposed to them.
c.	Deep Learning (DL): A further subset of ML; uses multi-layered neural networks to tackle very complex data and tasks.
