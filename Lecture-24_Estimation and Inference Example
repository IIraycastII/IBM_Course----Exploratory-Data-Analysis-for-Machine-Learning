Lecture 24: 
Estimation and Inference Example

Learning Goals

In this lecture, we’ll apply what we learned about estimation and inference using a real-world dataset.
We’ll explore how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer churn data to understand patterns, relationships, and insights that inform statistical and predictive models.

By the end of this lecture, you’ll learn how to:

Analyze customer churn behavior using the Telco Customer Churn dataset

Visualize relationships between churn rate and customer characteristics

Use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for exploratory visualizations

Interpret insights that connect estimation and inference to real business problems

Dataset Overview

We’ll use the Telco Customer Churn dataset from IBM Cognos Analytics, which represents customer characteristics and churn outcomes for a fictional telecommunications company.

Key features include:

Account type and payment method

Customer demographics and satisfaction scores

Revenue per customer and customer lifetime value (CLTV)

Churn indicators — whether a customer left (active cancellation, non-renewal, etc.)

For this example, we’ll use the phone subscription subset, stored in a Pandas DataFrame called df_phone.

1. Churn by Payment Type

We begin by examining how payment method relates to churn likelihood.

import seaborn as sns
sns.barplot(x="payment_type", y="churn_value", data=df_phone, ci=None)


This bar plot compares average churn rates across payment types.

Insight:
Customers who pay via credit card are less likely to churn than those who use bank withdrawals or mailed checks.
This quick estimate gives an initial clue about feature importance and customer behavior.

2. Churn by Customer Tenure

To explore how time as a customer affects churn, we create tenure groups using pd.cut:

import pandas as pd
df_phone["tenure_bins"] = pd.cut(df_phone["tenure_months"], bins=5)
sns.barplot(x="tenure_bins", y="churn_value", data=df_phone, ci=None)


Interpretation:
Customers with shorter tenures are much more likely to churn, while long-term customers show higher retention.
This aligns with common business intuition — loyalty increases with tenure.

3. Exploring Relationships with Pair Plots

We use Seaborn’s pairplot() to visualize relationships between numerical variables:

sns.pairplot(df_phone, vars=["tenure_months", "gb_usage", "total_revenue", "cltv"],
             hue="churn_value")


Observations:

Green points (churned customers) often cluster around lower tenures and lower revenues.

Blue points (retained customers) tend to have higher CLTV and longer tenure.

Distributions visually confirm trends between churn and key metrics.

This helps us estimate correlations and identify influential variables for future modeling.

4. Joint Plot with Hexbins

Finally, we use a joint plot with hexbin visualization to analyze the relationship between tenure in months and monthly charges:

sns.jointplot(x="tenure_months", y="monthly_charge", data=df_phone, kind="hex")


Interpretation:

Densely packed regions (darker hexagons) represent concentrations of customers.

Most customers have high tenure and higher monthly charges, suggesting premium customers are more loyal.

Another dense region at low tenure and high charges indicates new, high-paying customers who might churn early.

This gives both estimation insights (who’s likely to churn) and inference context (why they might churn).
