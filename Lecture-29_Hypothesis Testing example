Hypothesis Testing example

Concept Overview:
This example demonstrates how hypothesis testing works using a coin-tossing scenario. The goal is to determine which coin is more likely to have been chosen, based on observed data — in this case, the number of heads in 10 tosses.

Setup:

Coin 1: Probability of heads = 0.7

Coin 2: Probability of heads = 0.5

One of these coins is chosen at random (unknown) and tossed 10 times.

Based on the number of heads observed, we decide which coin is more likely.

Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The coin is fair (50/50).

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The coin is biased toward heads (70/30).

Process:

Compute Probabilities:
Using the Binomial distribution, calculate the probability of observing each possible number of heads (0–10) for both coins:

𝑃(𝑋=𝑘)=(10𝑘)𝑝𝑘(1−𝑝)10−𝑘
P(X=k)=(k10)pk(1−p)10−k

where 
𝑝
p = probability of heads for each coin.

Interpret the Pattern:

Lower numbers of heads (e.g., 2–4) are more likely under the fair coin (0.5).

Higher numbers of heads (e.g., 7–10) are more likely under the biased coin (0.7).

Example:
Suppose we observe 3 heads out of 10 tosses:

𝑃(3 heads∣0.5)=0.117
P(3 heads∣0.5)=0.117

𝑃(3heads∣0.7)=0.009
P(3 heads∣0.7)=0.009

The likelihood ratio = 0.117/0.009=13
0.117/0.009=13

⇒ The result (3 heads) is 13 times more likely if the coin were fair than if it were biased.

Key Concept — Likelihood Ratio:

The likelihood ratio quantifies how much more likely one hypothesis is compared to the other, given the observed data.

Likelihood Ratio=𝑃(data∣𝐻0)𝑃(data∣𝐻1)
Likelihood Ratio=P(data∣H1)P(data∣H0)
	​


A higher ratio supports the null hypothesis (H₀); a lower ratio supports the alternative hypothesis (H₁).

Takeaway:

This simple coin example illustrates the core logic of hypothesis testing:

We compare how probable our observed data is under two competing hypotheses.

The more likely explanation (based on computed probabilities) guides our decision.

This reasoning forms the basis for all hypothesis tests — whether about coins, customer arrivals, or machine performance.
