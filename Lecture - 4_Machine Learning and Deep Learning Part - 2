Machine Learning and Deep Learning – Part 2

Challenges of Defining Features in Images:

Unlike structured datasets, defining features in images is far more complex and highlights the limitations of traditional Machine Learning.

In traditional ML, humans manually define features. But for images:

Each pixel represents numerical data corresponding to its color value.

Even a small image (e.g., 256 × 256 pixels) contains 65,000+ features — one per pixel.

Treating each pixel independently ignores spatial relationships (e.g., how pixels together form a nose or an eye).

This inability to capture relationships between neighboring pixels makes image recognition difficult for classical ML algorithms.

How Deep Learning Addresses These Challenges:

Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses deep neural networks to automatically learn features from data.

Instead of humans manually defining features:

Deep neural networks learn and combine pixel patterns to understand shapes and spatial structures.

They can detect edges, curves, and complex features like eyes, noses, or entire faces.

Thus, Deep Learning eliminates the need for explicit feature engineering and can handle complex problems such as image classification (e.g., cat vs. dog).

What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning involves multi-layered neural networks capable of automatically extracting and combining features from raw input data.

It is a subset of Machine Learning that focuses on large and complex datasets.

Deep Learning models are highly powerful but also data-hungry and computationally intensive.

Performance Comparison:

With large, stable datasets, Deep Learning can outperform traditional ML by a wide margin.

With small or frequently changing datasets, traditional ML often performs better and is easier to train.

Classical Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning:
Aspect	Classical Machine Learning	Deep Learning
Feature Definition	Human experts manually define features before training.	Neural networks automatically learn features from data.
Interpretability	Features are human-understandable.	Intermediate features are often abstract and hard to interpret.
Data Requirement	Works well on small to medium datasets.	Requires large datasets for good performance.
Computation	Less computationally intensive.	Requires high computational power (GPUs/TPUs).
Adaptability	Performs better with changing or dynamic data.	Performs best with stable, high-volume data.
Feature Learning Process in Deep Learning:

Input: The neural network receives raw pixel values from the image.

Hidden Layers:

Early layers learn simple features like edges or colors.

Middle layers combine these into shapes and textures.

Deeper layers identify high-level objects like eyes, faces, or animals.

Output: The network uses the learned patterns to classify or recognize the image.

Though the intermediate features may not be directly interpretable, they are crucial for achieving high accuracy in tasks like image classification.
