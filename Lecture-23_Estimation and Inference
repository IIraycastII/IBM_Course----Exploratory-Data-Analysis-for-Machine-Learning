Lecture 23:
Estimation and Inference

Learning Goals

In this lecture, we’ll explore fundamental statistical concepts that form the backbone of machine learning and data-driven decision-making. By the end of this lecture, you’ll understand:

The difference between estimation and inference in statistics

The distinction between parametric and non-parametric modeling approaches

Common statistical distributions seen in real-world data

The conceptual difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics

Estimation vs. Inference

Estimation focuses on calculating a point estimate — a single number representing a population parameter (like the mean) based on sample data.

Example of estimation (sample mean):

𝑥ˉ=∑𝑥𝑖𝑛
xˉ=n∑xi

Here, you sum all sample values and divide by the total number of observations to estimate the average.

Inference, on the other hand, goes beyond point estimates.
It involves drawing conclusions about the population, including uncertainty measures such as the standard error or confidence intervals.

The standard error measures how much our sample mean might vary from the true population mean — essentially, it captures the "average distance" of our estimates from the true parameter.

Connecting Statistics and Machine Learning

Machine learning and statistical inference share a deep connection:

Both use sample data to infer properties about a larger population.

A data-generating process (like a linear model) defines how features 
𝑋
X relate to target 
𝑌
Y.

In statistical inference, we often seek to understand underlying parameters and their effects.

In machine learning, we may care more about prediction accuracy than understanding each parameter.

In short:

Inference focuses on understanding why and how,
Machine learning often focuses on what and how well.

Business Example: Customer Churn

To ground these concepts, let’s consider a real-world scenario — predicting customer churn.

Goal: Identify whether a customer is likely to leave a company.

Target variable: churn (1 if the customer left, 0 if not)

Features: Customer tenure, purchase history, spending amount, age, location, etc.

Machine learning models can output a churn probability for each customer:

Example: 0.99 → very likely to leave, 0.01 → likely to stay.

Estimation in Context

When estimating, we might compute the impact of each feature on churn.
For instance:

“Each additional year as a customer reduces churn probability by 20%.”

That 20% is a point estimate — our best guess based on sample data.

Inference in Context

Inference extends this estimate by adding uncertainty bounds — giving us a confidence interval.

Example:

“With 95% confidence, each additional year reduces churn by between 19% and 21%.”

This tells us that the estimate (20%) is statistically reliable.

If the interval were wide — say, between -10% and 50% — we’d know our estimate isn’t statistically significant.
It could even mean we don’t have enough data to be confident about the direction of the effect.
