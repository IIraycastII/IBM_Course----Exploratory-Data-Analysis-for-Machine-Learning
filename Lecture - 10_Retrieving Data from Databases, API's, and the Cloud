Lecture 10
Retrieving Data from Databases, APIs, and the Cloud
Learning Goals

In this lecture, we’ll explore how to retrieve data from different structured and unstructured sources, including:

SQL databases (relational)

NoSQL databases (non-relational)

APIs

Cloud data sources

We’ll also discuss common issues and best practices when connecting to these data sources.

Retrieving Data from SQL Databases

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases with a fixed schema.

Examples:

Microsoft SQL Server

PostgreSQL

MySQL

AWS Redshift

Oracle DB

IBM Db2

Popular Python libraries for SQL:

sqlite3 (for SQLite)

SQLAlchemy (works with multiple SQL databases)

psycopg2 (PostgreSQL)

ibm_db (Db2)

Example: Reading from SQLite with Pandas

import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

path = 'data/classic_rock.db'
con = sqlite3.connect(path)

query = "SELECT * FROM rock_songs"
df = pd.read_sql(query, con)

Retrieving Data from NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are non-relational and often store data in JSON format.

Types of NoSQL databases:

Document databases: Each document represents an observation (e.g., MongoDB)

Graph databases: Maintain relationships between entities (e.g., LinkedIn connections)

Wide-column families: Group columns logically for a person’s personal vs professional details

Example: Reading from MongoDB

from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd

con = MongoClient("your_mongo_db_url")  # Include username/password if needed
db = con.database_name  # Specify database

cursor = db.collection_name.find({})  # Query: select all
data_list = list(cursor)  # Convert to list of dictionaries
df = pd.DataFrame(data_list)  # Load into Pandas DataFrame

Retrieving Data from APIs and the Cloud

Many platforms provide data via APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

Examples:

Twitter API for tweets

Amazon marketing data

Public datasets (e.g., UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository)

Example: Reading CSV from a URL

import pandas as pd

data_url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"
df = pd.read_csv(data_url)


This allows direct access from the web without downloading files manually.
