Lecture 27: 
Frequentist vs Bayesian Statistics (Expanded with Business Context — Queuing Theory Example)

Learning Goals

By the end of this lecture, you will understand:

The conceptual and mathematical difference between Frequentist and Bayesian statistics.

How both frameworks apply to business scenarios, specifically queuing theory — e.g., determining staffing or server needs.

How prior knowledge and data volume influence estimation and inference.

1. Introduction: Two Philosophies of Probability

At the foundation of all statistical reasoning lies a key question:

What does “probability” mean?

For Frequentists, probability represents the frequency of an event occurring over repeated experiments.

For Bayesians, probability represents a belief or degree of certainty about a parameter, updated as new evidence arrives.

Both use the same mathematical tools (likelihood, distribution functions, etc.), but they interpret them differently.

2. Frequentist Statistics — Relying Purely on Data

In the Frequentist world:

Parameters (like the true mean, variance, or λ in a Poisson process) are fixed but unknown.

The data we observe is random, as it represents one of many possible samples from the population.

We use repeated sampling and long-run frequencies to make inferences.

In short:

“The probability of an event is the proportion of times it would occur if we repeated the experiment infinitely many times.”

Example: Queuing Theory in a Frequentist Framework

Imagine managing a grocery store checkout system.
You want to know how many cashiers to schedule per hour.

Let’s model the number of customers arriving per minute using a Poisson distribution (common for count-based, time-dependent events).

You don’t assume any prior knowledge.
You simply observe data — say, customer arrivals every minute for 30 days.

A Frequentist would:

Calculate the mean rate (λ) from this data — e.g., 4 customers per minute.

Treat λ as a fixed but unknown true rate.

Use confidence intervals to describe uncertainty.

For example:

“We are 95% confident that the true arrival rate lies between 3.7 and 4.3 customers per minute.”

This conclusion depends purely on data, not on any prior belief or historical assumptions.

3. Bayesian Statistics — Combining Prior Beliefs with Data

The Bayesian framework views parameters as random variables — each having its own probability distribution.
Instead of being fixed, the parameter (like λ) can take on multiple plausible values, each with a probability.

We begin with a prior belief — a distribution representing our knowledge before seeing new data.
Then we use Bayes’ theorem to update this belief after observing data.

𝑃(Parameter∣Data)=𝑃(Data∣Parameter)×𝑃(Parameter)𝑃(Data)
P(Parameter∣Data)=P(Data)P(Data∣Parameter)×P(Parameter)
	​

Example: Queuing Theory in a Bayesian Framework

Let’s revisit the same grocery store.

Suppose you already have prior experience suggesting that, historically, around 5 customers per minute tend to arrive.
That’s your prior distribution for λ.

Now, after collecting new data, you find that during this month, the rate appears to be slightly lower — around 4 customers per minute.

The Bayesian process is:

Start with a prior: λ ~ belief centered at 5.

Collect data: observe sample data indicating 4 per minute.

Update: apply Bayes’ theorem to get a posterior distribution — your updated belief about λ, now centered closer to 4.3.

Over time, as you collect more data:

The posterior distribution becomes narrower, indicating higher confidence.

The influence of the prior diminishes — data dominates.

This is one of Bayesian statistics’ key strengths:

You can incorporate expert knowledge and keep updating your beliefs as real data arrives.

4. Comparing Frequentist vs Bayesian Thinking
Aspect	Frequentist	Bayesian
Philosophy	Probability = long-run frequency	Probability = degree of belief
Parameter treatment	Fixed but unknown constant	Random variable with a probability distribution
Role of prior knowledge	Ignored — only data matters	Incorporated through prior distributions
Uncertainty expression	Confidence intervals (based on resampling)	Posterior distributions (belief updates)
Computation	Typically analytical, faster	Often uses computational methods (e.g., MCMC)
Interpretation	“We are 95% confident this interval contains the true parameter.”	“There’s a 95% probability the parameter lies within this interval.”
When useful	Large datasets, frequent experiments	Small datasets, domain expertise, or sequential updates
5. Mathematical Summary

Frequentist:

𝑃(Data∣𝜃)P(Data∣θ)

→ “Given θ, how likely is this data?”

Bayesian:

𝑃(𝜃∣Data)=𝑃(Data∣𝜃)×𝑃(𝜃)𝑃(Data)
P(θ∣Data)=P(Data)P(Data∣θ)×P(θ)
	​


→ “Given this data, how likely is each possible θ?”

6. Interpretation Difference Simplified
Question	Frequentist Answer	Bayesian Answer
What is λ (average arrivals per minute)?	A fixed value estimated from repeated samples.	A probability distribution expressing belief in possible λ values.
What is uncertainty?	Sampling variability.	Uncertainty in our belief about the parameter.
How to improve certainty?	Collect more data.	Collect more data or refine priors with expert knowledge.
7. Key Takeaways

Frequentist inference depends only on the data — it assumes no prior knowledge and focuses on repeatable, long-run frequencies.

Bayesian inference allows for prior beliefs to guide early estimates, updating them as new data comes in.

In real-world business settings (like queuing, forecasting, or customer behavior modeling), Bayesian methods shine when you have limited data but domain expertise — while Frequentist methods are efficient when large amounts of data are available.

Both approaches use similar mathematics but differ fundamentally in interpretation and philosophy.
