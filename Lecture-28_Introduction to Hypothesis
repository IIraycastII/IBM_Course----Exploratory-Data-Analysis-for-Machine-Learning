Introduction to Hypothesis

Concept Overview:
Hypothesis testing is a statistical procedure used to make inferences about population parameters (such as the mean of a Poisson distribution) based on sample data. It helps determine whether the observed data provides enough evidence to support or reject a specific assumption about the population.

Key Components:

Hypothesis Definition:

A hypothesis is a statement about a population parameter.

Example: The average number of customers arriving per hour is 5.

Two Competing Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The baseline or specific claim (e.g., mean = 5).

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Represents a deviation from the null (e.g., mean > 5 or mean ≠ 5).

The null is typically the more specific statement, while the alternative is broader (e.g., “greater than” or “not equal to”).

Decision Process:

Based on sample data, we decide to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

It’s often said you can reject the null but never truly accept the alternative—you just proceed as if it’s more likely.

Frequentist vs Bayesian Interpretation:

Frequentist: Uses a test statistic and compares it to a decision boundary to decide whether to reject H₀.

Bayesian: Does not use a hard boundary—instead, it computes posterior probabilities of both hypotheses and identifies which one is more likely given the observed data.

Example (Motivation):

Consider a coin-flip experiment or a queue at a grocery store.
We might hypothesize that the average number of arrivals per hour is 5. After collecting sample data, hypothesis testing helps determine whether the true average is likely still 5 (null) or if it’s significantly higher (alternative).

Takeaway:

Hypothesis testing is the bridge between data and decision-making.

It formalizes uncertainty and gives a structured way to test assumptions.

The Bayesian version enhances this by continuously updating beliefs as more data becomes available.
