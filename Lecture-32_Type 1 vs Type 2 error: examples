Lecture-32
Type 1 vs Type 2 error: examples

In this lecture we’ll review important hypothesis-testing terminology and see concrete business examples that show how to apply these concepts. By the end you should be able to:

Compute and interpret a test statistic

Define rejection and acceptance regions and the null distribution

Apply hypothesis-testing logic to marketing, web A/B, and product-quality problems

Sketch the data you’d collect and the EDA you’d run before testing

Key Terms

Test statistic

A scalar summary computed from sample data that we use to decide whether to reject 𝐻0

Examples: z-score, t-statistic, likelihood ratio (coin example).

The test statistic converts raw sample evidence into a single value compared against a decision rule.

Rejection region (critical region)

The set of test-statistic values for which we reject the null hypothesis.

Defined by the chosen significance level (e.g., 
𝛼
=
0.05
α=0.05) or an equivalent decision boundary.

Acceptance region

The complement of the rejection region: values for which we fail to reject (accept) 𝐻0.
Null distribution

The probability distribution of the test statistic assuming 𝐻0 is true.

Used to compute p-values or critical thresholds.

Business Examples & How to Frame the Tests

Marketing Campaign Effect

Question: Does a direct-mail campaign increase purchase rate?

Hypotheses:

𝐻0: Campaign has no effect (purchase rate unchanged).
H1: Campaign increases purchase rate.

Data to collect: Randomized treatment/control groups, purchases within time window, covariates (customer segment, spend history).

EDA: Baseline balance check, purchase-rate histograms, conversion over time.

Test/statistic: Difference in proportions (z-test) or logistic regression coefficient + Wald test.

Website Layout A/B Test

Question: Does the new layout affect traffic or conversion?

Hypotheses:

𝐻0: No change in traffic/conversion.

𝐻1: Layout causes a change (two-sided) or improvement (one-sided).

Data to collect: Randomized user assignment, session metrics, conversion events, time of day.

EDA: Time-series plots, segment-level effects, bounce-rate distributions.

Test/statistic: t-test or proportion test; or regression with treatment indicator.

Product Quality / Size Check

Question: Are products meeting size standard 𝑆S?

Hypotheses:

𝐻0: Mean size = 𝑆
S (within tolerance).

𝐻1: Mean size ≠ 𝑆
S (out of spec).

Data to collect: Random samples from production lots/sources, measurement uncertainty.

EDA: Boxplots by factory, distribution / outlier checks, measurement repeatability analysis.

Test/statistic: One-sample t-test (or ANOVA if comparing factories).
